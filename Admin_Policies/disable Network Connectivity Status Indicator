Network Connectivity Status Indicator (NCSI) try to open a 4Byte Ncsi.txt textfile to test if your internet connection works or not.

If a DNS request to 'dns.msftncsi.com' works but the file download fails, you got a message that your internet may be modified and see a info at network system tray icon.
But even if the DNS query doesnt work, you got a network error-icon at network system tray icon.

The best solution is just disable the windows service:

Go to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet
and change the DWORD string
EnableActiveProbing
to
0

Finish.
